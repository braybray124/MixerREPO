ðŸ§© MixerREPO â€“ Community Package Metadata Archive

This repository is a temporary home on GitHub until a proper site, mirrors, and sync network are set up.
Itâ€™s a community-driven archive for package metadata used by my custom package manager.

Each .toml file describes how to build and install a package â€” where to fetch sources, what flags to use, and how to handle dependencies. Think of it as the brain of the system: these are not the binaries, just the instructions.

Originally designed for LFS and MLFS systems (mostly MLFS due to multilib support), but youâ€™re free to fork it and strip it down for pure 64-bit setups or other configurations.

Got a package you want to share?
Add your own .toml metadata, submit a PR, or tweak existing ones â€” this is meant to grow as a community mirror of build data and scripts.

So yeah â€” no fancy site yet, just a working hub.
Have fun experimenting, building, and improving!
